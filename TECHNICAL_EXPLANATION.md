# Technical Explanation: Hindi Emotion Classification using BioBERT, BlueBERT & MultiBERT

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive emotion classification system for Hindi emotional poetry using three transformer-based language models: BioBERT, BlueBERT, and MultiBERT. The research investigates the effectiveness of domain-specific biomedical models versus multilingual models for cross-lingual emotion analysis in Hindi text.

## Technical Architecture

### Model Implementations

The project implements six distinct model variants across three transformer architectures:

1. **MultiBERT Models**: Built on `bert-base-multilingual-cased`, designed for multilingual understanding
2. **BioBERT Models**: Based on `dmis-lab/biobert-base-cased-v1.1`, pre-trained on biomedical literature
3. **BlueBERT Models**: Using `bionlp/bluebert-base-uncased-ms`, specialized for clinical text processing

Each model is implemented with both basic configurations and enhanced versions incorporating Hindi emotional embeddings. The core architecture consists of:

- **Base Transformer Layer**: Pre-trained BERT variants with 12 transformer layers
- **Classification Head**: Linear layer with dropout (0.3-0.6) for regularization
- **Optional Feature Fusion**: Integration of Hindi emotional embeddings (100-dimensional)

### Hindi Emotional Embeddings System

A key innovation is the development of a comprehensive Hindi emotional vocabulary system containing 200+ terms across six categories:

- **Core Emotions**: दर्द (pain), खुशी (happiness), प्रेम (love), डर (fear)
- **Intensity Modifiers**: बहुत (very), तीव्र (intense), गहरा (deep)
- **Poetry Terms**: कविता (poetry), गजल (ghazal), शेर (couplet)
- **Psychological States**: मन (mind), आत्मा (soul), भावना (emotion)
- **Relationship Terms**: रिश्ता (relationship), दोस्ती (friendship)
- **Life Concepts**: जिंदगी (life), समय (time), मौत (death)

The embeddings are computed using random initialization with uniform distribution [-0.1, 0.1] and averaged when multiple emotional terms are present in the text.

## Dataset and Preprocessing

### Dataset Characteristics

- **Size**: 240 balanced samples (80 each: Negative, Neutral, Positive)
- **Source**: Hindi emotional poetry with diverse linguistic expressions
- **Quality**: 91.7% consistency rate through manual validation
- **Language**: Pure Hindi text with Devanagari script

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Unicode normalization and whitespace handling
2. **Label Encoding**: Systematic emotion-to-integer mapping
3. **Stratified Splitting**: 70% training, 20% testing, 10% validation
4. **Tokenization**: Model-specific tokenizers with max length 128-512 tokens
5. **Feature Extraction**: Optional Hindi emotional embeddings integration

## Training Methodology

### Hyperparameter Optimization

The training employs carefully tuned hyperparameters based on empirical analysis:

- **Learning Rates**:
  - MultiBERT: 1e-5 (reduced from 2e-5 for stability)
  - BioBERT: 1e-5 (optimized for biomedical domain)
  - BlueBERT: 5e-6 (significantly reduced to prevent class collapse)
- **Batch Size**: 8 (memory-optimized for available hardware)
- **Epochs**: 6-10 (conservative strategy to prevent overfitting)
- **Sequence Length**: 128 tokens (optimal for Hindi poetry)

### Regularization and Stability Features

To address overfitting and training instability:

- **Enhanced Dropout**: 0.5-0.6 (increased from baseline 0.3)
- **Weight Decay**: L2 regularization (0.01-0.025)
- **Gradient Clipping**: Maximum norm 0.5-1.0
- **Early Stopping**: Patience of 3-4 epochs with validation monitoring
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: ReduceLROnPlateau with factor 0.3-0.5
